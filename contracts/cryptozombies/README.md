# ethereum-zombies

I went through cryptozombies to review the tutorial as a tool to recommend for new devs looking go explore ethreum development. I found the pacing to be solid, the topic fun, and the ability to create something interactive to be fulfilled. I believe room for improvement lies in making this a full stack experience. 

Here is the code for the contracts from the completed cryptozombies course. Of course, it won't do much without some frontend, but maybe that's a project myself or others could pick up and provide.
