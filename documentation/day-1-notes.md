Smart Contract Anatomy 
* Ethereum/ Solidity


##Applications
* Supply chain/ traceability
* Fintech
* Real estate, titles, fractional ownership
* Health / data records management
* Accounting
* Insurance
* Energy / Carbon Credits

## Public Key Cryptography
* priv/pub key pairs
* priv keys to be guarded - if i have priv key - i am that person

# History / Details
* 2009
* days destroyed = transaction volume
* turing complete roughtly means it can compute any number that is able to compute
* directed acyclic graph, directed tree, making it more difficult for ASIC mining
* vitalik canadian-russion in 2013
* smart contracts cannot initiate themselves, need initiation from external accounts (user accounts / oracles)
* Oracle = trusted 3rd party . not at center, they are at the 'edge'

## Presentation on Iota Security & deepdefense.net
* Founded after working in DC think tank, partener with NATO
* Kenetic and cyber risks of IoT
* Replace people with Machine Learning to detect threats on mobile devices
* 80% malware focuses on Android
* 95% of people fail to install security on devices.
* Singularity University
* Xield token
* Sell threat intelligence
* Take open source wallet and mod it for Xield token & SDK
* Antivirus w/ wallet built in 
* Users get paid for data sent to xield
* If they want security, they send Xield token
