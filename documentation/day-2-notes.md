# Day 2

## Intro
  # Instructor: Neeraj S Srivastava
* DLT Labs - Distributed Ledger Technology
* R3 Corda
* Truth vs. Consensus
* Blockchain is an ecosystem - not a technology
* DLT has 13 verticals in the ecosystem
  * examples infrastructure, programming, security, cryptography, philosophy, strategy
* Pick a vertical & stick to it
* JP Morgan Corda - takes base of ethereum with newer components - fork of ethereum
  * Ethereum is very modular - has proof of work and proof of authority in module
  * Can switch consensus algorithm after launch (with effort) while everything else remains the same
* Byzantine fault tolerance theory
  * Incentivizes systems to try to come in sync where before there was no incentive
  * Old databases can only be updated one record at a time - if n number of nodes, who gets the right to update the db at any given time?

## Yesterday
* Proof of Stake vs. Proof of Authority
* Mist has node-finding capabilities

# GETH Details
Go through geth in detail and understand
* ABI Definition

* compiile object from geth itself

# Using Remix
Good as a debugger for singular contracts and debugging. Not for enterprise development
* Shows how Remix works behind the scene

# Truffle Framework
When using multiple contracts, truffle is useful for interacting contracts. Use when deployment and testing
